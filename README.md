This repo holds examples of the classes and inheritance we covered in week 6 of Rampup


### How to use

Execute directly
----------------

$ ruby ./path/to/file.rb

eg.
$ ruby ./rectangle.rb

Executing a file directly will execute the tests in that file



Require in IRB
--------------

$ irb
irb(main):001:0> require './path/to/file.rb'

eg.
irb(main):001:0> require './rectangle.rb'


Requiring a file in IRB will give you access to those classes but not execute the tests
